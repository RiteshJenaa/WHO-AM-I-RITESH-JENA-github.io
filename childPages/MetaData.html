      <h2>My Life:</h2>
      <h3>I am a student in grade 10 attending W.P. Wagner school. I am 14 years old as of right now. My birthday is on March 4th 2007. I took this course to have a glimpse into the world of software development and coding. I have learnt a lot in the past few weeks of this class.</h3>
      <h3>My career aspirations are to become a physician and help others. I have wanted to make a career in health and medicine since I was a kid and I want to attend medical school after post secondary. I also want to pursue my side hobby of content creation and make youtube videos alongside my job as a doctor.</h3>
